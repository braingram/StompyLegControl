  Angles [gazebo]
    hip angle
        looking down on robot + is CCW
        0 resting (straight out)
    thigh angle
        looking at side with leg pointed right, + tilts down
        0 resting
        angles always +
    knee angle
        looking at side with leg pointed right, - tilts up
        0 resting
        angles always -
  Positions [gazebo] in leg space
    x
        looking at side with leg pointed right + is out (right)
        never -
        minimum is... (depends on z)
    y
        looking down on leg pointed right + is up, - is down
        positive and negative
    z
        looking at side with leg pointed right, - is down
        0 is in line with hip joint, below this is -


  All hip string pots are at REAR
    - for right legs, increasing cylinder length should increase angle
    - for left legs, increasing cylinder length should decrease angle
